# 2022 Mid-Year Examination Language Arts Notes

The Language Arts Mid-Year Examination has two components:
1. [Critical Literary Analysis of Prose](#clap)
2. [Argumentative Writing](#argumentative-writing)

---

## CLAP

 - Quote Judiciously
 - Pay attention to the Question
```
Example Qn: Identify evidence that shows that the village seemed hospitable.

1. "Appeared to be warmly welcoming" ✅ Just nice
2. "Warmly welcoming" ❌ Missing out on the "seemed", too short
3. "Appeared to be warmly welcoming from above" ❌ "from above" not answering the question, too long
```
 - Write the first "suitable" thing that comes to your mind (Ie. Do not overthink)
 - If you doubt that something answers a question, try and think of something else

```

Example Qn: What does "" suggests about how the writer was feeling?

1. He felt tired. - ❌ Not answering the question, not an emotion
2. He felt miserable. - ✅ Someone feels miserable.

Can replace "feeling" with "emotional state" and see if "tired" works.

```

- Do not say `not [something]`

``` 

Example Qn: What was the weather like that day?

1. The weather was hot and dry ✅
2. It was not raining ❌
```

- Language Use for Impact:

The question will always be about `Explain how the language used shows how [adjective] the [thing] was`.

Thus, in your answer, you should try and include it as part of your answer, in the form of a synonym. You might want to annotate the question.s

For example: `"[Quote]" suggests that [Explanation], causing [Adjective]`.  

- Identifying and Explaining Imagery

The template is `The [Type] imagery "[Quote]" suggests/presents/shows [Explanation]`.

Your explanation should not merely rephrase the imagery, as this is one of the few instances in CLAP where you actually need to look one level deeper instead of writing the first thing which comes to mind.

```
Example: The car coughed and spluttered to life.

Answer: The auditory imagery "coughed and spluttered to life" suggests that the car was noisy and loud. 
❌ Merely restating the imagery without imagery. 

Answer: The auditory iamgery "coughed and spluttered to life" suggests that the car had difficulty starting up, due to its old age. 
✅ This answer looks one level deeper and actually explains the connotation of the expression of imagery.
```

- Unusual and Effective Expressions

Template:

`The expresion is unusual as it compares [thing] which is [definition/nuance] to [thing] which is [definition/nuance].`  
`The expressions is effective as it shows how [Explanation]`

Usually, it is either:

1. Using a verb on a unsuitable noun

Eg. "Air filled the *lungs* and made them *chortle*"  
- Lungs cannot laugh
- The ride was exhilarating

2. Seldom-Used Expression or Word

[No example available at the moment]

3. Tangible with Intangible

Eg. "Conscience is a man's compass"
- Man's conscience is intangible while a compass is a tangible object used for navigation
- Moral sense helps to guide us and make decisions just like using a compass to navigate

4. Oxymoron-Oxymoron (Opposite)

Eg. "Michelle has been *busy* doing *nothing*"  
- Busy means that someone has much work to complete which is the opposite of having no work at all
- Only thing she has been doing is lazing around

5. Living with Non-Living

[Similar to Point 1]

## Argumentative Writing

Three types of Questions:

1. "*Quote*" Do you agree?
2. "*Quote*" To what extent do you agree?
3. Should *subject* be *this*?

The only difference between these three are the stand and the thesis statement.

Plan before you write:  
    •	2 Bullet Points (Reduced from 3 PEELs)  
    •	Supporting Evidence should go beyond hypothetical examples  

Formal Writing with Objective Tone:  
    •	Your point should not support any other argument (Exclusive to the topic)  
    •	Hedging and Softening of Tone  
        o	All authoritative parents will listen to their children with open minds (Too Absolute)  
        o	Most authoritative parents will listen to their children with open minds (Best)  
        o	Most authoritative parents might/will probably listen to their children with open minds (Weak)  

        
•	Informal Expressions (E.g. Kids, Guys)
•	Do NOT use contractions (“It’s” still a contraction)
Pronoun inconsistency
•	The child, their parents
•	Do not use “/”, E.g. Him/Her – this is not proper punctuation in an essay
•	Instead, just choose one pronoun and stick with it.
o	Children raised under authoritative parents are often stressed as they are forced to meet expectations. You are constantly pursuing academic success and are not allowed to play
Introduction should have engaging hook and clear thesis.
Topic Sentence should address or engage essay question directly. Don’t save the best for last (E.g. One should not be able to find a stronger “P” somewhere in the paragraph).
•	Authoritative parenting guides a child who may not know best.
•	Authoritative parenting styles guide children who do not know any better and this is why they should not be outlawed.
Conclusion should include paraphrased thesis AND a short reflection on the topic. (Check Pink Booklet for More)
Make sure to sound “Atas” for your vocabulary marks (Check JANAB)
Your point must be correct and mature in the first place.
Your sentence should not make sense only to you.
Try not to use “like” to give examples. Use “such as” or “this includes”.
“It is indeed advisable to” instead of “One strongly agrees” in the stand.
