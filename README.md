# 2022 Mid-Year Examination Language Arts Notes

The Language Arts Mid-Year Examination has two components:
1. [Critical Literary Analysis of Prose](#clap)
2. [Argumentative Writing](#argumentative-writing)

---

## CLAP

 - Quote Judiciously
 - Pay attention to the Question
```
Example Qn: Identify evidence that shows that the village seemed hospitable.

1. "Appeared to be warmly welcoming" ✅ Just nice
2. "Warmly welcoming" ❌ Missing out on the "seemed", too short
3. "Appeared to be warmly welcoming from above" ❌ "from above" not answering the question, too long
```
 - Write the first "suitable" thing that comes to your mind (Ie. Do not overthink)
 - If you doubt that something answers a question, try and think of something else

```

Example Qn: What does "" suggests about how the writer was feeling?

1. He felt tired. - ❌ Not answering the question, not an emotion
2. He felt miserable. - ✅ Someone feels miserable.

Can replace "feeling" with "emotional state" and see if "tired" works.

```
## Argumentative Writing

Three types of Questions:

1. "*Quote*" Do you agree?
2. "*Quote*" To what extent do you agree?
3. Should *subject* be *this*?

The only difference between these three are the stand and the thesis statement.
